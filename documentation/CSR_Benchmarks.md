**Discriminative Tasks:** Goal is to pick a single answer from the list

**Generative Tasks:** Goal is to generate one or more correct answers.



## Examples

### SocialiQA 

SOCIAL IQ~A~ contains 38,000 multiple choice questions for probing emotional and social intelligence in a variety of everyday situations (e.g., Q: *“Jordan wanted to tell Tracy a secret, so Jordan leaned towards Tracy. Why did Jordan do this?”* A: *“Make sure no one else could hear”*). The reasoning types covered are: motivation; what happens next; and emotional reactions.
