## AMR

Unit of annotation: sentence
Base language: English
Datasets: PropBank framesets, English words, framework-dependent keywords

Format: Single rooted DAG
Notation: Penman
Extensions: DAMR (disjunctive AMR)
Level: deep-semantic
Limitations: Lack of universal quantifier 'all'. No real vs hypothetical event structure.
